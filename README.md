The aim of this project is to create an e-commerce website that sells tiles, marble, ply, and sunmica online, while also having an offline market through an Excel-based application. The project also incorporates data visualization using Power BI and performance testing using JMeter.
The e-commerce website will provide an easy and accessible platform for customers to purchase their desired products, which will be categorized and presented in a user-friendly manner. 

In addition, the website will provide information on the products available, such as descriptions, sizes, and prices, to assist customers in making informed decisions.
The offline application developed using Visual Basic will be used to manage the offline market and will serve as an alternative for customers who prefer to purchase their products in person. The application will have a similar layout to the e-commerce website and will be used by sales representatives to manage the orders, payments, and inventory of the offline store.
The use of Power BI will enable users to visualize data from both the online and offline markets in a manner that is both informative and easy to understand. 

This will provide insights into the performance of both markets and will assist in identifying trends and patterns that could impact the business.
JMeter will be used to conduct performance testing on the website, which will help identify any issues with website speed, responsiveness, and scalability. This will assist in ensuring that the website can handle a large volume of traffic and will provide a smooth shopping experience for customers.
In conclusion, the project will provide an integrated solution for managing both online and offline markets for a business selling tiles, marble, ply, and sunmica. 

By incorporating features such as an e-commerce website, an offline application, data visualization using Power BI, and performance testing using JMeter, the project aims to provide an effective and efficient solution that is beneficial for both the business and its customers.
